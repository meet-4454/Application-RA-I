BRIEF to the assignment: 
  1. Combine 'Date' and 'Time'('datetime')
  2. Take this index for the entire assignment
  3. Filter out March 2007 from the data set and find the mean active power of the filter
  4. Check the total power consumed each hour on  25/12/2006 and return the hour having the highest of all day
  5. Create a bool value 'is_weekend', find out the mean power consumption for isWeekend and !isWeekend (weekday)
  6. Group by the dataset by day, and find out the total consumption, return days having consumption > 5 kWh
  7. Select the timeline: 1/1/2007 - 7/1/2007, plot the consumption v/s timeline
  8. Filter out the first week of February, and group by this filter by day. Determine the mean power consumption for each day
  9. Find the correlation between global active power and sub-metering values. 
 
The dataset hasn't been uploaded due to a large file size.
